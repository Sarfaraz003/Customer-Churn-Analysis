# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Customer retention is a critical challenge for businesses, especially in subscription-based industries like telecom. This project analyzes a **Telco Customer Churn dataset** to identify factors influencing customer churn and builds a predictive model to help businesses reduce churn and improve long-term customer relationships.  

## 🎯 Objective  
- Understand customer behavior and identify key drivers of churn.  
- Develop a predictive model to classify customers as likely to stay or churn.  
- Translate insights into actionable business recommendations that can improve retention strategies.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: R  
- **Techniques**: Logistic Regression, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization  
- **Libraries**: ggplot2, caret, dplyr  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source**: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
- **Features**: Customer demographics, account information, services used, contract type, and churn status.  

## 🔍 Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, standardized variables, and prepared categorical features for modeling.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized churn distribution across demographics, services, and contracts.  
   - Found strong churn patterns linked to **contract type, tenure, and payment method**.  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Applied **Logistic Regression** to predict churn.  
   - Evaluated performance using classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve).  

4. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Short-term contracts, month-to-month payments, and lower tenure customers are most likely to churn.  
   - Retention strategies should focus on **loyalty programs, discounts for longer contracts, and personalized offers**.  

## 📈 Key Results  
- Built a reliable classification model to predict customer churn.  
- Identified top churn drivers with clear business impact.  
- Developed **data-driven recommendations** to support decision-making.  

## 🚀 Business Value  
This project demonstrates how statistical modeling and data analysis can:  
- **Reduce revenue loss** by targeting at-risk customers.  
- **Enhance customer satisfaction** through tailored retention strategies.  
- **Support leadership decisions** with evidence-based insights.  

## 💡 Future Enhancements  
- Experiment with advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost).  
- Build a dashboard for interactive churn monitoring.  
- Incorporate customer feedback/sentiment data for richer insights.  

## 👤 About Me  
I am a **Postgraduate in Statistics** passionate about applying data-driven approaches to solve real-world business problems. This project reflects my ability to combine **statistical knowledge, analytical thinking, and business storytelling** to deliver actionable insights.
