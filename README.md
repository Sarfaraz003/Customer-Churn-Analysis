# Customer-Churn-Analysis
🔍 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for businesses today. Retaining customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, and predicting churn allows companies to take preventive actions.

This project uses data analysis and predictive modeling to identify customers who are likely to churn, uncover the key drivers of churn, and provide actionable insights for retention strategies.

🎯 Objectives
Understand the patterns and behaviors of churned vs. active customers

Identify key factors influencing churn (e.g., usage, spending, complaints)

Build a predictive model to estimate the probability of churn

Generate business insights & recommendations to reduce churn
